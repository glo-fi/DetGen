# To set up a metasploit database, follow the directions hosted at:
# http://r-7.co/MSF-DEV#set-up-postgresql
#
# Kali Linux and the Omnibus installers both include an easy wrapper script for
# managing your database, which may be more convenient than rolling your own.

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: msfdb
  username: msf
  password: d3t134rs0m
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  pool: 200
  timeout: 5

# You will often want to seperate your databases between dev
# mode and prod mode. Absent a production db, though, defaulting
# to dev is pretty sensible for many developer-users.

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
#
# Note also, sqlite3 is totally unsupported by Metasploit now.
