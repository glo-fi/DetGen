This scenario consists of a streamer, who uploads a video to an nginx server to be livestreamed to a viewer over RTMP. The video is hosted at the address rtmp://172.26.5.2/stream/watch.

Currently, the video is randomly selected from any videos stored in streamer-share/videos and are all streamed with the same configuration.

The scenario can be started via the capture-stream.sh script.
